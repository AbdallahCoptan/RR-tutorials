### Sharing Code and Data

\bbegin{}

* Is this enough?
     1. Use a work ow that _documents both data and process_
     2. Use the machine readable _CSV format_
     3. Provide _raw_ data and _meta_ data, not just statistical outputs
     4. _Never_ do data manipulation and statistical tests _by hand_
     5. Use R, Python or another free software to read and process raw data
          - ideally to produce complete reports with code, results and prose
